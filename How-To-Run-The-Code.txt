Firstly, open a terminal in vs code. Install and create a virtual environment:
	pip install virtualenv  
	python3 -m venv myvenv 
 
For mac:
	source myvenv/bin/activate

For windows:
	Myvenv\Scripts\activate

In your virtual environment install Django, pillow:
	pip install Django
	pip install pillow
	pip install numpy
	pip3 install psycopg2-binary

After all installations, copy and paste the project folder into the folder where virtual environment is active.

In the terminal change directory to where "populate_imgs.py" is and run this file only to upload the images using the command:
	python populate_imgs.py

Change directory to the CAPTCHA folder and run the project with:
	python manage.py runserver

NOTE: The PostgreSQL database settings in settings.py have been commented so it does not have to be installed before the execution. 
If the project is to be tested without PostgreSQL, there is no need to install it.
If the project has to be tested with PostgreSQL, then it is recommended to install PostgreSQL. During installation, remember the user, name and password. In settings.py comment lines 77-82, uncomment lines 83-90 and replace the desired pairs.
